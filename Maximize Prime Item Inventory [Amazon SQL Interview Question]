Amazon wants to maximize the number of items it can stock in a 500,000 square feet warehouse. It wants to stock as many prime items as possible, and afterwards use the remaining square footage to stock the most number of non-prime items.

Write a query to find the number of prime and non-prime items that can be stored in the 500,000 square feet warehouse. Output the item type with prime_eligible followed by not_prime and the maximum number of items that can be stocked.

Effective April 3rd 2023, we added some new assumptions to the question to provide additional clarity.

Assumptions:

Prime and non-prime items have to be stored in equal amounts, regardless of their size or square footage. This implies that prime items will be stored separately from non-prime items in their respective containers, but within each container, all items must be in the same amount.
Non-prime items must always be available in stock to meet customer demand, so the non-prime item count should never be zero.
Item count should be whole numbers (integers).
inventory table:
Column Name	Type
item_id	integer
item_type	string
item_category	string
square_footage	decimal
inventory Example Input:
item_id	item_type	item_category	square_footage
1374	prime_eligible	mini refrigerator	68.00
4245	not_prime	standing lamp	26.40
2452	prime_eligible	television	85.00
3255	not_prime	side table	22.60
1672	prime_eligible	laptop	8.50
Example Output:
item_type	item_count
prime_eligible	9285
not_prime	6
The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!
