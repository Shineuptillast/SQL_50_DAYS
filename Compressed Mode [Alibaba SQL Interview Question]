Given a table containing the item count for each order and the frequency of orders with that item count, write a query to determine the mode of the number of items purchased per order on Alibaba. If there are several item counts with the same frequency, you should sort them in ascending order.

Effective April 22nd, 2023, the problem statement and solution have been revised for enhanced clarity.

items_per_order Table:
Column Name	Type
item_count	integer
order_occurrences	integer
items_per_order Example Input:
item_count	order_occurrences
1	500
2	1000
3	800
4	1000
Example Output:
mode
2
4
Explanation
Based on the example output, the order_occurrences value of 1000 corresponds to the highest frequency among all item counts. Specifically, both item counts of 2 and 4 have occurred 1000 times, making them tied for the most common number of occurrences.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

Solution-->
1)with count_frequency as (
                            select *,
                            rank() over(order by order_occurrences desc) as max_frequency
                            from items_per_order)
  select item_count as mode
  from count_frequency
  where max_frequency =1;
