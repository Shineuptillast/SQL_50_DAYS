This is the same question as problem #12 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

Assume you're given a table with information on Amazon customers and their spending on products in different categories, write a query to identify the top two highest-grossing products within each category in the year 2022. The output should include the category, product, and total spend.

product_spend Table:
Column Name	Type
category	string
product	string
user_id	integer
spend	decimal
transaction_date	timestamp
product_spend Example Input:
category	product	user_id	spend	transaction_date
appliance	refrigerator	165	246.00	12/26/2021 12:00:00
appliance	refrigerator	123	299.99	03/02/2022 12:00:00
appliance	washing machine	123	219.80	03/02/2022 12:00:00
electronics	vacuum	178	152.00	04/05/2022 12:00:00
electronics	wireless headset	156	249.90	07/08/2022 12:00:00
electronics	vacuum	145	189.00	07/15/2022 12:00:00
Example Output:
category	product	total_spend
appliance	refrigerator	299.99
appliance	washing machine	219.80
electronics	vacuum	341.00
electronics	wireless headset	249.90
The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

Solution-->
1) with highest_grossing_items as (select  category,
        product,
        SUM(spend) as total_spend
from product_spend
where date_part('year',transaction_date)=2022
group by category, product),



cte as (select   * ,
                row_number() over(partition by category order by total_spend desc)
                as rnk
from highest_grossing_items)

select category, 
      product,
      total_spend
from cte where rnk<=2
