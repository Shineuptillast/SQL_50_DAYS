A Microsoft Azure Supercloud customer is a company which buys at least 1 product from each product category.

Write a query to report the company ID which is a Supercloud customer.

As of 5 Dec 2022, data in the customer_contracts and products tables were updated.

customer_contracts Table:
Column Name	Type
customer_id	integer
product_id	integer
amount	integer
customer_contracts Example Input:
customer_id	product_id	amount
1	1	1000
1	3	2000
1	5	1500
2	2	3000
2	6	2000
products Table:
Column Name	Type
product_id	integer
product_category	string
product_name	string
products Example Input:
product_id	product_category	product_name
1	Analytics	Azure Databricks
2	Analytics	Azure Stream Analytics
4	Containers	Azure Kubernetes Service
5	Containers	Azure Service Fabric
6	Compute	Virtual Machines
7	Compute	Azure Functions
Example Output:
customer_id
1
Explanation:
Customer 1 bought from Analytics, Containers, and Compute categories of Azure, and thus is a Supercloud customer. Customer 2 isn't a Supercloud customer, since they don't buy any container services from Azure.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!
Solution
1)with total_bought as (select cc.customer_id,
       count(distinct product_category) as bought_per_id 
from customer_contracts cc
inner join
products p on cc.product_id = p.product_id
group by cc.customer_id)
select customer_id
from total_bought 
where bought_per_id >=(select count(distinct product_category) from products)
;
