A phone call is considered an international call when the person calling is in a different country than the person receiving the call.

What percentage of phone calls are international? Round the result to 1 decimal.

Assumption:

The caller_id in phone_info table refers to both the caller and receiver.
phone_calls Table:
Column Name	Type
caller_id	integer
receiver_id	integer
call_time	timestamp
phone_calls Example Input:
caller_id	receiver_id	call_time
1	2	2022-07-04 10:13:49
1	5	2022-08-21 23:54:56
5	1	2022-05-13 17:24:06
5	6	2022-03-18 12:11:49
phone_info Table:
Column Name	Type
caller_id	integer
country_id	integer
network	integer
phone_number	string
phone_info Example Input:
caller_id	country_id	network	phone_number
1	US	Verizon	+1-212-897-1964
2	US	Verizon	+1-703-346-9529
3	US	Verizon	+1-650-828-4774
4	US	Verizon	+1-415-224-6663
5	IN	Vodafone	+91 7503-907302
6	IN	Vodafone	+91 2287-664895
Example Output:
international_calls_pct
50.0
Explanation
There is a total of 4 calls with 2 of them being international calls (from caller_id 1 => receiver_id 5, and caller_id 5 => receiver_id 1). Thus, 2/4 = 50.0%

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!
Solution-->
1) with calls as (select A.caller_id,
       A.receiver_id,
       A.call_time,
       A.caller_country, pi_2.country_id as receiver_country
from
(select pc_1.caller_id as caller_id,
        pc_1.receiver_id as receiver_id,
        pc_1.call_time as call_time,
        pi_1.country_id as caller_country
from phone_calls pc_1
inner join phone_info pi_1
on pc_1.caller_id = pi_1.caller_id) A
inner join phone_info pi_2 
on a.receiver_id = pi_2.caller_id
order by A.caller_id)

select round(100.0*sum(case when calls.caller_country <> calls.receiver_country then 1 else 0 end)/count(*) ,1) from calls;
